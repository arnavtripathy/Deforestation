Deforestation is an ongoing framework as the name suggests, designed to destory a forest after gaining domain admin access. It contains some recon functions mainly just for confirmatation before "destroying" a forest. Mainly , it provides an easy way of changing ACL's of an object for persistence and stealth. Use it carefully in a real enterprise as it can lead to some dangerous changes if done blindly. Main features include:-

-Quick recon

-ACL Auditing

-User and groups auditing

and many more


Features which I am planning to add:-

-Better error handling

-Some more recon features

-Log management
